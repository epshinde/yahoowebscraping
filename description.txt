1) For this problem, I did not have much difficulty using mongodb or BeautifulSoup. Most of the challenges I encountered were with PHP. I initially did not know how to sort the records based on the six fields, until I found the sort option inside the find function for MongoDB objects. I have experience with Python and PHP, but not with MongoDB. However, knowing about JSON beforehand did help me in understanding MongoDB better.
